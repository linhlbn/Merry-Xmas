# Merry-Xmas
### Merry Xmas Mini Games

I made this website for gifting a girlfriend (a friend who is a girl) in the Christmas day.
She needs to sign in with the right user name and code - something that I suggested her before. After answering the right answer, she may find some fabulous thing will be appeared on the screen, it should be: 

* nice gif that she can change her mobile locked screen as a video
* autoplay music
* writing her name on the new snow areas 
* download link for the Android app (the music notes challenging) 
* mini javascript game 
* draw picture as she wants
* sing this song: Imagine Dragons - Demons cover by me
* special: random quotes will change on the home page every time she clicks to show more content, also have some buttons to 'teleport' to the new content
